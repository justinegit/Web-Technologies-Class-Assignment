        <h1>What is Web Technology?</h1>
        <h3>You probably know that computers don't communicate with each other the way that people do. Instead, computers require codes, or directions. These binary codes and commands allow computers to process needed information. Every second, billions upon billions of ones and zeros are processed in order to provide you with the information you need.

            So what does that have to do with your ability to post your latest pictures online? Everything.
            
            The methods by which computers communicate with each other through the use of markup languages and multimedia packages is known as web technology.</h3>
